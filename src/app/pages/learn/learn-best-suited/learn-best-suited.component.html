      <p class="bottomParagraph">For a student, the Tax-Free Savings Account is the most suitable option as it allows tax-free growth on savings and immediate access to money. The Tax-Free ETF Savings Account could also be a good  choice if the student is interested in investing in exchange-traded funds within a tax-free framework. It is important for the student to consider their financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment preferences when selecting the most appropriate account.</p>
